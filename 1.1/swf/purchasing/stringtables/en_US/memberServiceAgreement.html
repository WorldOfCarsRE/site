Welcome to Disney/Pixar World of Cars Online game (the "Service").
PLEASE READ THIS MEMBER AGREEMENT, THE DISNEY TERMS OF USE, AND THE
DISNEY Rules of the Road CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS SERVICE. This
Service is owned and operated by Disney Online (referred to as "Disney,"
"we," "us," or "our" herein). By using this Service, you agree to this
World of Cars Online Game Member Agreement, the Disney Terms of Use
[http://disney.go.com/legal/conditions_of_use.html], and the Disney
Rules of the Road [http://disney.go.com/guestservices/netiquette.html]
(collectively, the "Agreement"). If you do not agree to each of these
documents in their entirety, please do not use the Service. Please note
that you will be referred to from time to time as "Member" in this
Agreement. The person who purchases the Service may also be referred to
as the "Account Holder" in this Agreement. "Account" means the account
registered to any Member, pursuant to the registration procedures for
the Service. The terms of this Agreement apply to all Members and users
of the Service via the Account, whether or not they are the Account
Holder. The Account Holder is responsible for making each of the Members
of their Account (and anyone else they may allow access to their
Account) aware of the terms of this Agreement and for ensuring
compliance. The Account Holder for an Account is entirely liable for all
activities conducted through that Account. We reserve the right, in our
sole and absolute discretion, to change, modify, add, or remove
(collectively, "Change" or the "Changes") portions of this Agreement
(including the Terms of Use and Rules of the Road) at any time, and
Changes will be effective immediately upon posting of the revised
Agreement at the domain or subdomain where the prior version was posted.
It is the Member’s responsibility to review these terms, the Terms of
Use, and the Rules of the Road for any Changes. Although notification of
Changes to this Agreement may from time to time be posted on the Service
or sent via e-mail or postal mail, such notification does not waive or
otherwise excuse Member’s affirmative obligation to review the Agreement
for Changes, and to understand and agree to the most up-to-date terms of
the Service. We suggest that you review the terms of this Member
Agreement, the Terms of Use, and the Rules of the Road for Changes each
time prior to using the Service. If any future Changes to this Agreement
are unacceptable to you, or cause you to no longer be in compliance with
this Agreement, you must terminate your Account. Your continued use of
the Service following Changes to this Agreement (including the Terms of
Use and Rules of the Road) will signify that you accept those Changes.
We may change, modify, suspend, or discontinue any aspect of the Service
at any time, including, without limitation, the availability of any
Service feature, database or content, hours of availability, or
equipment needed to access the Service. We may also impose limits on
certain features or restrict your access to parts or all of the Service
for extended periods of time, without notice or liability. We reserve
the right to interrupt the Service with or without prior notice for any
reason or no reason, and you shall not be entitled to any refunds of
fees for interruption of the Service or its otherwise failure to
perform. We cannot guarantee that this Service or any data stored or
transmitted in connection with it will be uninterrupted, error-free, and
secure of viruses and other malware. We are not an Internet provider and

Internet access software and modems. We do not guarantee that the
Service will operate on any specific equipment or any particular
operating system, and we are not responsible for any damage, either
temporary or permanent, to equipment or software in connection with
using the Service. RESTRICTIONS ON USE OF MATERIALS All materials

THIS SERVICE ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND
EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMISSIBLE PURSUANT TO
APPLICABLE LAW, DISNEY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. DISNEY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE
FUNCTIONS CONTAINED IN THE SERVICE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE,
THAT DEFECTS WILL BE CORRECTED, OR THAT THIS SERVICE OR THE SERVER THAT
MAKES IT AVAILABLE ARE FREE OF VIRUSES OR OTHER HARMFUL COMPONENTS.
DISNEY DOES NOT WARRANT OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OR
THE RESULTS OF THE USE OF THE MATERIALS IN THIS SERVICE IN TERMS OF
THEIR CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE. YOU (AND NOT
DISNEY) ASSUME THE ENTIRE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR, OR
CORRECTION. APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. WITHOUT
LIMITATION OF THE FOREGOING, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT, AS A SERVICE TO USERS
OF THE DISNEY SERVICE, WE INCLUDE LINKS TO OTHER WEB SITES ON THE WORLD
WIDE WEB PORTION OF THE INTERNET AND THAT DISNEY HAS NO CONTROL OVER,
AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND WHATSOEVER, REGARDING THE
CONTENT OR APPROPRIATENESS OF CONTENT ON SUCH WEB SITES, AND YOU HEREBY
IRREVOCABLY WAIVE ANY CLAIM AGAINST US WITH RESPECT TO SUCH WEB SITES.
Further, Disney explicitly disclaims any responsibility for the
accuracy, content, or availability of information found on sites that
link to or from the Services from third parties not associated with
Disney. Disney encourages discretion when browsing the Internet using
our or anyone else's service. Because some sites employ automated search
results or otherwise link you to sites containing information that may
be deemed inappropriate or offensive, Disney cannot be held responsible
for the accuracy, copyright compliance, legality, or decency of material
contained in third-party sites, and you hereby irrevocably waive any
claim against us with respect to such sites. Disney cannot ensure that
you will be satisfied with any products or services that you purchase
from a third-party site that links to or from the Service since other
shop channels are owned and operated by independent retailers. Disney
does not endorse any of the merchandise, nor has Disney taken any steps
to confirm the accuracy or reliability of any of the information
contained in such third-party sites. Disney does not make any
representations or warranties as to the security of any information
including, without limitation, credit card and other personal
information you might be requested to give any third party and you
hereby irrevocably waive any claim against us with respect to such
sites. We strongly encourage you to make whatever investigation you feel
necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline
transaction with any of these third parties. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY
UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE, SHALL
DISNEY BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES THAT RESULT
FROM THE USE OF, OR THE INABILITY TO USE, THE MATERIALS IN THIS SERVICE
OR ANY OTHER WEB SITE, EVEN IF DISNEY OR A DISNEY AUTHORIZED
REPRESENTATIVE HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
APPLICABLE LAW MAY NOT ALLOW THE LIMITATION OR EXCLUSION OF LIABILITY OR
INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THE ABOVE LIMITATION OR
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. IN NO EVENT SHALL DISNEY'S TOTAL
LIABILITY TO YOU FOR ALL DAMAGES, LOSSES, AND CAUSES OF ACTION (WHETHER
IN CONTRACT, TORT INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NEGLIGENCE OR
OTHERWISE) EXCEED THE AMOUNT PAID BY YOU, IF ANY, FOR ACCESSING THE
SERVICE. SECURITY As part of the registration process, Members will
select a password and account ID ("Account ID"). We reserve the right to
delete or change your Account ID for any reason or no reason. You shall
provide Disney with accurate, complete, and up-to-date Account
information. Failure to do so shall constitute a breach of this
Agreement, which may result in immediate termination of your Account or
other measures, including legal action. You may not (i) select or use an
Account ID of another person with the intent to impersonate that person,
including Account IDs that are deliberately misleading or deceptive as
to the identity of the Member; (ii) use a name subject to the rights of
any other person without authorization; or (iii) use a Account ID that
Disney, in its sole and absolute discretion, deems inappropriate or
offensive. Without limiting any of its additional rights in this
Agreement or otherwise, Disney reserves the right to enforce these
security measures at any time, and Disney’s allowance of an Account ID
shall not be considered a waiver of our ability to terminate, suspend,
or otherwise reevaluate your Account at a later time. You shall notify
Disney by e-mail at security_breach@help.go.com of any known or
suspected unauthorized use(s) of your Account, or any known or suspected
breach of security, including loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure of
your password. You shall be responsible for maintaining the
confidentiality of your password. Any fraudulent, abusive, or otherwise
illegal activity may be grounds for termination of your Account, at
Disney's sole and absolute discretion, and you may be reported to
appropriate law-enforcement agencies. PRICE AND PAYMENT Disney reserves
the right at any time to charge additional fees for access to the
Service. Disney reserves the right to change the amount of, or basis for
determining, any fees or charges for the Service, and to institute new
fees or charges effective upon prior notice to Members via the email
address of record on the Member’s account or posting upon the domain or
subdomain of the Service or any other method that is designed to provide
reasonable notice to Members. Disney reserves the right to provide the
Service at no charge for promotional reasons or otherwise (such as a
free subscription or trial). PROVISION OF PROMOTIONAL TRIALS OR OTHER
PREFERRED OR DISCOUNTED ACCESS TO SOME MEMBERS (INCLUDING, BUT NOT
LIMITED TO, FULL OR LIMITED SUBSCRIPTIONS OFFERED FREE OF CHARGE) SHALL
NOT OBLIGATE DISNEY TO PROVIDE SUCH PROMOTIONS, DISCOUNTS, OR PREFERRED
ACCESS TO OTHER MEMBERS. Each Account Holder agrees to pay all charges
to the Account, including applicable taxes, in accordance with billing
terms in effect at the time the fee or charge becomes payable. Account
Holders must provide Disney with valid information as requested during
the registration process, which may include (but is not limited to)
credit card information, promotional codes, or other means of payment.
If you have reason to believe that your Account is no longer secure (for
example, in the event of a loss, theft, or unauthorized disclosure or
use of your Account ID, Password, or any credit, debit, PayPal, or
charge card information stored on the Service), you must promptly change
your Password and notify Disney of the problem (by giving notice as
described in the Notice section below) to avoid possible liability for
any unauthorized charges to your Account. If Account Holder is paying by
credit card (including debit and other charge cards): Disney shall
charge the Account Holder's credit card on the date Account Holder
subscribes to the Service or if you have signed up for a free trial
period, Disney shall charge the Account Holder’s credit card on the day
that the free trial expires. Thereafter, Disney will automatically renew
and charge the Account Holder as follows: -Upon every one (1)-month
anniversary of the first billing date for monthly subscriptions -Upon
every six (6)-month anniversary of the first billing date for semiannual
subscriptions -Upon every one (1)-year anniversary of the first billing
date for annual subscriptions The renewal charge shall be equal to or
less than the original subscription price, unless otherwise notified in
advance by Disney via the email address of record on the Member’s
account or posting upon the domain or subdomain of the Service or any
other method that is designed to provide reasonable notice to Members.
You may notify Disney that you wish to cancel your subscription at any
time. Disney agrees that it will terminate your Account upon receipt of
notification from the Account Holder, as described below. For monthly
subscriptions: If notice of cancellation is received within the first
fifteen (15) days following the first day of the initial billing, you
will be eligible to receive a refund of all subscription fees for the
Service, but will still be obligated to pay any other charges incurred.
Your access to the Service will be canceled immediately. For semiannual
and annual subscriptions: If notice of cancellation is received within
the first thirty (30) days following the first day of initial billing,
you will be eligible to receive a refund of all subscription fees for
the Service but will still be obligated to pay any other charges
incurred. If you cancel the Service more than thirty (30) days after the
initial billing, no refund for unused time will be given. Your right to
use the Service is subject to any limits established by Disney or by
your credit card issuer. If payment cannot be charged to your credit
card or your charge is returned to Disney for any reason, including
chargeback, Disney reserves the right to either suspend or terminate
your access and Account. PARENTAL CONSENT Under the Children's Online
Privacy Protection Act ("COPPA"), parental consent is required for the
online collection, use and/or disclosure of personal information
obtained from a child under the age of thirteen (13). When purchasing
the Service, the Account Holder may be asked to provide a valid credit
card. If paying by credit card, children will need to have a parent or
legal guardian register as the Account Holder. By providing his or her
credit card number, the Account Holder: (a) represents and warrants that
he or she will be the Account Holder; (b) represents and warrants that
he or she is the parent or legal guardian of any child under the age of
thirteen (13) for whom he or she allows to use the Account; and (c)
agrees to our collection, use and disclosure of personal information in
accordance with the Privacy Policy [http://disney.go.com/corporate/
legal/wdig_privacy.html] with respect to any child under the age of
thirteen (13) for whom the Account Holder allows to use the Account.
NOTICE The Account Holder will submit, maintain, and keep up to date a
correct e-mail address and other Account information. Without waiving or
excusing Member’s obligation to review the terms of this Agreement
(including the Terms of Use and Rules of the Road) for changes, we may
give notice to the Account Holder by means of a general notice on the
Service, electronic mail to your e-mail address on record in our Account
information, by written communication sent by first-class mail to your
address on record in our Account information or by any other method that
is designed to provide reasonable notice to Members. You may give notice
to Disney. Such notice shall be deemed given when received by Disney at
any time by e-mail at MemberServices@WorldOfCarsOnline.com. AUTOMATED
GAMEPLAY AND OTHER CHEATING METHODS Use of any software, code, device or
other mechanism that allows automated gameplay, expedited gameplay, or
other manipulation of gameplay or game client will result in immediate
termination of the Account. Disney reserves the right, in its sole and
absolute discretion, to determine what constitutes manipulation of
gameplay or game client. NON-VERIFIABILITY OF CONTENT AND AFFIRMATIVE
OBLIGATION TO REPORT ABUSE Disney does not represent or endorse the
accuracy or reliability of any advice, opinion, statement, or other
information displayed, uploaded, or distributed through the Service by
any user, information provider, or other third-party individual or
entity. You acknowledge that any reliance upon any such opinion, advice,
statement, memorandum, or information shall be at your sole risk. Disney
reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to correct any errors or
omissions in any portion of the Service. Disney has limited ability, if
any, to oversee the quality, safety, morality, legality, truthfulness or
accuracy of the content of communications between users. You therefore
have an obligation to report all inappropriate behavior to Disney
immediately. If you continue to have problematic interactions with other
users, then you must stop using the Service immediately. TERMINATION OF
